__Current pack version:__ `v0.2-snapshot-5c`

Bored of the current phantoms? Want a new game mechanic? Want something spookier to spice up your Minecraft world? Manic simultaneously reworks the phantom system while attempting to provide a scary, innovative and challenging gameplay mechanic involving Sanity. Manic also provides new tech, tools, and items themed around Sanity.
Manic is compatible in both 1.17 and 1.18 snapshots. It may show errors on loading in 1.17, but it should work the same.

# 👁️ About 👁️
In short, Manic adds Sanity. Sanity is decreased by staying in the dark, sleepless nights, being in deep caves, and more, while it's increased by sleeping, eating healthy, being around pets, and more. At low levels of Sanity, the eyeball above your bar will open, and at even lower levels, it'll turn Green - this means you're in danger of Phantoms and their newfound friends spawning. But it isn't all bad; low levels of Sanity may even prove beneficial at times.

Manic also adds new tech content: for example, the Corpsebloom is a new plant that kills undead monsters for the player and produces Sanity in the form of Corpse Sap, which can be stored by its cousin, the Corpsegourd, or turned into new recipes and tool with the Corpsepitcher. Manic also completely reworks the Woodland Mansion to add a new boss fight, new illagers, and more themed around its new mechanics. Oh, did I mention that Manic adds cheese?<hr/>
